# üçÖTomatoWidget

This is a widget for [Trilium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) that displays a tomato timer. Inspired by [Tomato Timer Widget](https://github.com/Nriver/tomato-timer-widget), and [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io).

The integration with Trilium is minimal, mostly relying on the vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- Configurable Durations: Allows setting the duration for focus sessions, short breaks, and long breaks, as well as the interval for long breaks, through a configuration object.
- Progress Tracking: Visualizes progress within a Pomodoro cycle (focus and break sessions) using symbols (‚úÖ for completed, üìñ for current focus, üìö for upcoming), and displays the current cycle number.
- Automatic Start Option: Includes a toggle switch to automatically start the next timer (focus or break), based on user preference stored in localStorage.
- Reset and Skip Features: Enables resetting the timer to a selected mode or skipping the current session, facilitating user control over the schedule.
- Local Storage Integration: Saves timer settings, mode, count, and auto-start preference in the browser's local storage, ensuring consistency across sessions.
